What does Community mean to you?

# project overview

For Project Two, I chose Queen’s iconic song "We Are the Champions" as it represents the core values of a community of perseverance, teamwork, and shared victory. In sports and life, success is never achieved individually, it’s the collective effort of a group and teamwork toward a common goal. The powerful lyric, "We'll keep on fighting till the end," speaks to the relentless commitment and support that teammates offer each other through adversity.

This resonates with me deeply because, in my own experience, the community is about coming together, overcoming challenges, and celebrating achievements either big or small as a team. I wanted to bring that sense of belonging and accomplishment through this project.
