# What does Community mean to you? 

# project overview

For Project Two, I chose Queen’s iconic song "We Are the Champions" as it represents the core values of a community of perseverance, teamwork, and shared victory. In sports and life, success is never achieved individually, it’s the collective effort of a group and teamwork toward a common goal. The powerful lyric, "We'll keep on fighting till the end," speaks to the relentless commitment and support that teammates offer each other through adversity.

This resonates with me deeply because, in my own experience, the community is about coming together, overcoming challenges, and celebrating achievements either big or small as a team. I wanted to bring that sense of belonging and accomplishment through this project.

# technical overview 

I decided to use the Font style (Edu AU VIC WA NT Dots) in my website since it gives my website a unique, abstract, and joyful feeling, which suits the song quite nicely. 

Languages Used:

- HTML: Structure of the website and the placement of the text
- CSS: Styling for colors, fonts, animations, and layout of the text and background

Animations & Transitions:

- Transformations: Certain elements (such as images) have been translated, scaled, rotated, and skewed using CSS transformations to motion within the design

Software Utilized:

- Visual Studio Code: Used as the primary editor for writing HTML and CSS
- GitHub Pages: Used as the hosting platform to showcase the final website live
